      "Grim but determined, you and your team execute the plan to break into AveryCorp and save this digital dimension.",
      "Everything goes smoothly at first. You clear the 8ft high electric fence in the outer perimeter, swiftly weave past security bots, use the ID card forged by the Replicator to access the elevator shaft and hoist yourself in…",

      "As you crawl through the ventilation space, the Recruiter’s voice grows fuzzier and fuzzier until it blips out. The four of you are on your own.",
